the deliveries.csv :It contains (matchid, inning, batting_team, bowling_team, over, ball, batsman, non_striker, bowler, is_super_over, wide_runs, bye_runs, leg_bye_runs,  noball_runs, penalty_runs, batsman_runs, extra_runs, total_runs, player_dissmisal, dismissal_kind, filder   )
•	We have studied the above file and using the file deliveries.csv created a matchoverruns.csv  file which has the data about the runs scored in each over innings wise for a total of 8 innings along the course of 4 matches .

•	Now using this file we have plotted a heatmap (by using Seaborn library of Python).

•	we have ploted the Scatter plot of 8 innings using deliveries.csv file.

•	We have also ploted the clusters of the 8 innings with the help of K-Means clustering algorithm using runsovers.csv file.
