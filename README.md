creating heatmaps, scatter plots, and clustering of the points with the help of various libraries of python.
here, i have used the popular ipl_dataset

Status of Project : Partially Completed
Description: In the given data set i.e. IPL_DATA_SET there are total 6 .csv files and each of them  contains the data as follows:
1)teams.csv:
It contains the names of teams playing the IPL.
2) players.csv:
It contains (Player_Name, DOB, batting_hand, bowliong_skill,country). 
3) team_wise_home_and_away.csv:
It contains (team, home_wins, away_wins, home_matches, away_matches, home_win_percentage, away_win_percentage)
4) matches.csv :
It contains (id, season, city, date, team_1, team_2,  toss_winner, toss_decision, result, dl_applied, winner, win_by_runs, win_by_wickets, player_of_match, venue, umpire1, umpire2, umpire 3)
5) most_runs_average_strikerate.csv:It contains (batsman, total_runs, out, numberofballs, average, strikerate ).
6) the deliveries.csv :It contains (matchid, inning, batting_team, bowling_team, over, ball, batsman, non_striker, bowler, is_super_over, wide_runs, bye_runs, leg_bye_runs,  noball_runs, penalty_runs, batsman_runs, extra_runs, total_runs, player_dissmisal, dismissal_kind, filder   )

•	We have studied the above files and our program ,  using the file deliveries.csv creates a matchoverruns.csv  file which has the data about the runs scored in each over innings wise for a total of 8 innings along the course of 4 matches .
•	Now using this file we have plotted a heat map (by using Seaborn library of Python).Photos of which have also been attached  below.
